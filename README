	This is the useful "sock" program in W. Richard Stevens <TCP/IP v1>, I got the 
	source code from his home page, and did something.

1. Open a tcp server :
	$ ./sock -s <host/ip> <service/port>
and open a client to test it:
	$ ./sock <host/ip> <service/port>
2. Act as s UDP server
 	$ ./sock -u -s  <host/ip> <service/port>
3. "-A" to set the SO_REUSEADDR
